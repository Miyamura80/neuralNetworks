# neuralNetworks

Primarily a personal project to learn the mathematics and the inner working of artificial neural networks. This repo has 2 different attempts: 
1) One without using lists, without using numpy (Completely vanilla apart from matplotlib for visualization) 
2) One using numpy and matrix multiplication modules
